# Project_Taiwon_Bankruptcy_Using_Tree_-Ensemble_Model

Project Overview:
In this data science project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of bankruptcy in Taiwan, utilizing a JSON dataset. By implementing three powerful ensemble classifiers - Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, I aimed to predict bankruptcy risk accurately and gain valuable insights into the contributing factors.

Project Description:

Data Collection and JSON Integration:
I collected a comprehensive dataset containing financial and economic indicators from various companies in Taiwan, formatted in JSON. This dataset served as the foundation for conducting bankruptcy risk analysis.

Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
To ensure data integrity, I performed meticulous data preprocessing, handling missing values and transforming the JSON data into a structured format suitable for analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and patterns in the financial indicators and bankruptcy labels.

Ensemble Classifiers Implementation:
To develop robust bankruptcy prediction models, I deployed three ensemble classifiers - Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Each model leveraged the collective strength of multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy.

Model Evaluation and Comparison:
I evaluated the performance of each classifier using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A thorough comparison allowed me to identify the most effective model in predicting bankruptcy risk.

Feature Importance Analysis:
Using the selected ensemble classifier, I determined the importance of financial and economic indicators in predicting bankruptcy. This analysis provided valuable insights into the key factors contributing to bankruptcy risk in Taiwan.

Bankruptcy Prediction and Risk Assessment:
Leveraging the best-performing classifier, I made accurate predictions of bankruptcy risk for the companies in the dataset. This information was utilized to assess the financial health and stability of individual companies, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.

Recommendations:
Based on the project findings and feature importance analysis, I derived actionable recommendations for businesses and financial institutions to proactively manage bankruptcy risks. These insights enabled stakeholders to implement targeted measures and financial strategies to safeguard their financial stability.

Conclusion:
The Bankruptcy Prediction in Taiwan project showcased my expertise in data preprocessing, ensemble classifiers, and bankruptcy risk analysis. By leveraging these techniques, I gained meaningful insights into financial indicators and their impact on bankruptcy risk. The project exemplifies my commitment to utilizing data science to provide valuable solutions for financial risk assessment and decision-making in Taiwan's business landscape.
